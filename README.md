Play the maze over at https://lex-maze-game.herokuapp.com/

This game was made to explore implementing a recursive function, and deeply linked frontend interaction with backend logic. Check out the app/controllers/pages_controller to see the recursive function!

n.b. A rare bug is caused by rails double loading the player movement javascript file, causing the player to skip around. If this happens simply refresh the page.
